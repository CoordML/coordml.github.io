# CoordML

CoordML is an easy-to-use tool for automating ML experimenting. It supports defining computation tasks with a powerful and flexible DSL, Sircle. Tasks will be distributed to multiple computing instances whenever possible, and a web portal can be used to view current state of experiments and display aggregated experiment results in a clean and flexible way.
